  <h1>Pictures!! Using the img tag and background-image css property</h1>
  <p>Websites are more than just text. We can include images in our html documents in two ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>By using the img tag to include images in the flow of our document</li>
    <li>By using the background-img css property to include an image as the background of a block element</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Typically, images used as page content are included as image tags, and images used to decorate the background are included using the background image property. It is important to include any images that inform the reader about page content using the img tag, since this allows us to set an alt attribute for screen-readers.</p>
  <h2>Image Tag Examples</h2>
  <p>Lets try the image tag now. I've included an incomplete image tag in the text of this paragraph. <img src="" alt="A Polydactyl Cat"> Find the image described in the alt text on the image tag in the Assets folder and include the path to this image as the value for the src attribute to complete the tag.</p>
